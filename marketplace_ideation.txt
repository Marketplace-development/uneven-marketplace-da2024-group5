### Marketplace Ideation

Platform name: ViaVia

Short description: Our platform is a marketplace where travelers can share their personalized travel plans and tips, offering an alternative to expensive travel agencies. 
                   The goal is to make travel more affordable, varied, and tailored to each person’s needs. 
                   This platform is perfect for coming up with ideas for your own group or solo travel. 
                   It can also help you discover amazing locations you may never have thought of before.
                   Users can find travel suggestions based on their preferences, whether they want adventure, luxury, culture, relaxation,...
                   By using the experiences of others, the platform helps offer real, well-planned trips, with the option of local guides for a more personal touch. 
                   It’s a community-focused approach that values trust, ease, and unique experiences.

# UI Prototype

https://www.figma.com/

=> we made the following concepts using figma: 
We began by developing a prototype for a smartphone application. However, we later created a second prototype optimized for PC screens, as this approach was more practical for coding and testing on our laptops. 
Eventually, we discovered that using Bootstrap could effectively address the challenge of ensuring compatibility across different devices. 
Despite this, we chose to include both prototypes in our project to provide comprehensive insight into our development process
